# A Nagios Docker Container with PagerDuty

## Environment Variables

`PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY` To enable PagerDuty integration, set this to your
Integration Key value.

`NAGIOS_BASE_URL` The base URL to access Nagios at. Default: `/nagios/`

## Volumes and Configuration

You can configure Nagios by mounting a directory containing `nagios.cfg` to
`/opt/nagios/etc`. Note that if you set the `PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY`
environment variable, the entrypoint script will attempt to substitute that
value into a file at `/opt/nagios/etc/objects/pagerduty.cfg` (And also modify
a couple other files. See `files/entrypoint.sh` for details.)

You can also configure nginx by mounting to things under `/etc/nagios`. Note
that setting the `NAGIOS_BASE_URL` environment variable will cause the
entrypoint script to write to `/etc/nagios/conf.d/nagios.conf` if it exists.
